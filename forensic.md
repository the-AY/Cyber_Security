## Memory Forensic Tools

   * Volatility Suite: This is an open source suite of programs for analyzing RAM, and has support for Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems. It can analyze RAW, Crash, VMWare, and Virtualbox dumps with no issues.<br>

   * Rekall: This is an end-to-end solution for incident responders and investigators, and features both acquisition and analysis tools. It can be thought of as more of a forensic framework suite than just a single application.<br>

   * Helix ISO: This is a bootable live CD as well as a standalone application that makes it very easy for you to capture a memory dump or memory image of a system. There are some risks associated with running this directly on a target system, namely an acquisition footprint, so make sure that it fits your requirements.<br>

   * Belkasoft RAM Capturer: This is another forensic tool that allows for the volatile section of system memory to be captured to a file. First responders will find that the functionality and wide range of tools available in this software package will allow for their investigations to start off as quickly as possible.<br>

   * Process Hacker: This is an open source process monitoring application that is very useful to run while the target machine is in use. It will give the investigator a better understanding of what is currently affecting the system before the memory snapshot is taken, and can go a long way to help uncover any malicious processes, or even help to identify what processes have been terminated within a set period of time. <br>


## Disk Forensic Tools

* Autopsy is a digital forensics tool that is used to gather the information form forensics. Or in other words, this tool is used to investigate files or logs to learn about what exactly was done with the system. It could even be used as a recovery software to recover files from a memory card or a pen drive.
